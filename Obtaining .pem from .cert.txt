APNS cert handling:

1. get a cert via the dev portal
2. import into keychain access by doubleclicking it
3. export the public part of the cert from keychain as .p12 file
4. in terminal, create a .pem file from the p12 using this commmand:
	openssl pkcs12 -in /path/to/cert.p12 -out /path/to/cert.pem -nodes -clcerts
